# Project Description:
The project's goal was to create an application that would display a sample list of the curriculum at VMS. It should be able to display the two majors, 
Computer Science and Information Technology and their related courses. User would then be able to add whatever subjects they want within the semester table
in order to calculate the semester GPA and their overall GPA. 




# Limitation:
I was unable to resolve the issue with calculating the GPA as it keeps returning NaN. The two curriculum is near identical but I've change the first subject
to differentiate them from each other. Also, I wasn't able to implement the local storage.

# Features:
There are buttons on the subjects tables that allow the subject to be moved to the semester table and there is a remove button to clear it from the semester
table. You can change the curriculum by the dropdown button at the top, to go in between CS and IT
